# Iterators have some interesting properties that make them widely useful
# for not only indexed collections (e.g. Array) and other finite data structures (e.g. LinkedList or HashMap keys),
# but also for (possibly-infinite) generated data. We'll look at an example of that soon.

# The first property of an Iterator that we'll look at is that it only needs to know how to get the next item.
# It doesn't need to store the entire data in memory if we don't need the entire data structure.
# For massive data structures, this is invaluable!

# For example consider a linked list Iterator.
class LinkedListIterator:
    def __init__(self, head):
        self._node = head

    def hasNext(self):
        return self._node is not None

    def next(self):
        result = self._node.value
        self._node = self._node.next
        return result

# Notice how we store the head at the start,
# but as items are consumed, we discard the current one and replace it with the item in the node after?
# This means that if we're simply iterating a Linked List,
# and don't ever need to go back to the head, then we only need to keep one value around at a time.


# Another fascinating property of Iterators is that they can represent sequences without even using a data structure!
# For example consider a range Iterator:

class RangeIterator:
    def __init__(self, min, max):
        self._max = max
        self._current = min

    def hasNext(self):
        return self._current < self._max

    def next(self):
        self._current += 1
        return self._current - 1

# If we simply converted this to an Array, we'd need to allocate a large chunk of memory if min and max are far
# apart. For the most part, this would probably be wasted space. However, by using an Iterator, we can use features
# like for i in range(40, 20000000) while still retaining the O(1)O(1) space of classic for (int i = min; i < max;
# i++) style loops seen in other languages.

# Our final property is one that we couldn't even do by copying values into an Array—handling an infinite sequence.
# For example consider an Iterator of squares:

class SquaresIterator:
    def __init__(self):
        self._n = 0

    def hasNext(self):
        # It continues forever,
        # so definitely has a next!
        return True

    def next(self):
        result = self._n
        self._current += 1
        return result ** 2

# Notice that because .hasNext() always returns True, this Iterator will never run out of items. And this is to be
# expected, there's always another square after the previous, so our Iterator can give as many as we ask from it.


# Now that we've looked at why Iterators are awesome, let's consider what they are at a base level.
# An Iterator only provides two methods:

# .next() This returns the next item in the sequence. You can't assume that this item actually "exists" yet,
# it might be created when you call .next(), or it might already exist in a data structure that you have an Iterator
# over. Once .next() is called, it will update the state of the Iterator. This means once you've got a value from
# .next() you won't be able to get the same value again. Therefore, if you don't store or process the value you got
# from the Iterator then it's possibly gone forever!

# .hasNext() This returns whether another item is available. For example, an array Iterator should return False if
# we're at the end of the array. But for an Iterator that can produce items indefinitely, such as our square
# generator above, it might never return False.

# A further property of Iterators is that they provide a clean interface for the code using them.
# Without Iterators, Linked List's, for example, tend to be particularly messy,
# as the code for traversing them gets muddled within the application code.
# With an Iterator, the external code doesn't even know how the underlying data structure works.
# For all it knows, the data could be coming from
# a Linked List, an Array, a Tree, a State Machine, a clever number generator, a file reader, a robot sensor, etc.
#
# Not having to deal with nodes, state, indexes leads to clean code.
# We call this the Iterator Pattern,
# and it is one of the most important design patterns for a software engineer to know.
#
# As shown above, with only two methods, we get a lot of benefit (e.g. infinite sequences) and increased performance
# (e.g. not expanding sequences like range into arrays). We also get a nice way of separating the underlying data
# structure from the code that uses it.
